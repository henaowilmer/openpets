# Plugin Platform

OpenPets plugins are small companion programs that extend the pet: reminders,
focus timers, a Tamagotchi-style virtual pet, GitHub notifications, and so on.
This doc is the platform architecture — the manifest contract, the permission
model, the runtime and sandbox, install paths, and packaging/publishing. For the
*author-facing* API see [sdk.md](sdk.md); for the product direction and the
official lineup see [superplugins.md](superplugins.md).

This doc is required reading before changing plugin platform code, official
plugins, catalog generation, packaging, runtime behavior, or plugin-facing UI
(per `AGENTS.md`). When you change behavior, update this doc in the same change.

Source maps: `apps/desktop/src/codemap.md` (the `plugin-*.ts` modules),
`plugins/codemap.md`, `plugins/official/codemap.md`, `packages/sdk/codemap.md`.

## Mental model

A plugin is a **package** validated by a **manifest**, run inside a **sandbox**,
talking to the host only through a **permission-checked SDK bridge**. The host
owns every side effect — the plugin only *describes* what it wants (a bubble, an
alert, a scheduled job, a stored value), and the host validates and renders it.
This is the "companion-first" stance: plugins never inject UI into pet windows
directly; they hand the host descriptors and the host owns layout and lifecycle.

              pet · schedule · storage · ui · audio · events · bus · ai · …
```

## The manifest — `openpets.plugin.json`

The manifest is the contract the host validates before *any* plugin code runs
(`plugin-manifest.ts`, schema versions v1/v2/v3). Current plugins are
`manifestVersion: 3` / `sdkVersion: 3.x`. Key fields:

- `manifestVersion`, `id` (e.g. `openpets.reminders`), `name`, `description`,
  `version`, `sdkVersion`.
- `runtime`: `javascript` for SDK plugins (declarative timer-only plugins also
  exist for the simplest cases).
- `entry`: the JS entry file (e.g. `index.js`).
- `permissions`: the capabilities the plugin requests (see below).
- `configSchema`: typed config fields rendered as a no-JSON settings form.
  Field types include `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `time`, plus v3 types
  `date`, `secret`, `sound`.
- `assets`: declared icon/image/svg/sprite/sound refs (validated, see below).
- `commands`, `status`, `panels`, `network` hosts, and timer triggers as
  applicable.
- Localization: `name`/`description`/labels can be `$t:` keys resolved from
  `locales/en.json` (see [i18n.md](i18n.md)).

`name`/`description`/labels in the manifest use `$t:` references; the catalog
generator and release validator fail if those don't resolve.

### Manifest reading is hardened

`plugin-manifest-reader.ts` enforces realpath/allowed-root checks, requires the
manifest to be the root file, caps size, and matches the expected id/version.
The manifest is never trusted blindly.

## Permission model

Permissions are declared in the manifest, **approved** by the user at install,
persisted in plugin state, and **re-checked on every SDK call** by the bridge.
The permission surface (from `plugin-manifest.ts`):

`timer`/`schedule`, `pet:*`, `pets:*`, `audio`, `events`, `ui:*`, `notify`,
`bus`, `ai`, `secrets`, `voice:*`, `auth`, `files`, `system:*`, `clipboard`,
`network:*`.

A plugin that calls a namespace it didn't declare (or wasn't approved for) is
denied and the block is recorded in diagnostics. `network:*` is further
constrained to declared hosts. This is defense in depth: manifest validation,
user approval, runtime permission check, and quotas all apply.

## Runtime & sandbox

`plugin-runtime.ts` is the engine:

- Compiles **declarative timer triggers** for enabled manifests and schedules
  cancellable timers.
- Starts/stops a **JavaScript host** per JS plugin and verifies approved
  permissions before dispatching actions.
- Exposes public **command/status** state to the UI, validates actions, and
  **marks a plugin broken** on validation/action failure (surfaced in the
  inspector/health UI).

`plugin-js-host.ts` is the sandbox: a hidden `BrowserWindow` with a per-plugin
session partition, navigation/window-open hardening, an SDK IPC **token**, a
registration handshake at startup, config-listener cleanup, and teardown. The
plugin's `index.js` runs here, isolated from the renderer and the main process.

`plugin-sdk-bridge.ts` is the gate between the sandbox and the host. It
validates routes, builds the per-plugin context, enforces permissions + quotas,
and delegates to focused namespace modules (`plugin-sdk-audio`, `-bus`,
`-config`, `-events`, `-quotas`, `-routes`, `-state`, `-storage`, `-ui`, plus
`plugin-voice`, `plugin-oauth`, `plugin-secrets`, `plugin-ai-gateway`,
`plugin-panels`, `plugin-pet-api`/`plugin-pet-registry`). The split keeps each
capability's permission check and host effect localized. The author-facing
mirror of all this is the SDK in [sdk.md](sdk.md).

### Supporting modules

- `plugin-state.ts` — atomic JSON store (`userData/openpets-plugin-state.json`):
  installed plugins, enabled flag, approved permissions, config, source, broken
  reason, update metadata.
- `plugin-config.ts` — default/effective config validation and reference
  resolution.
- `plugin-assets.ts` — validates/resolves declared assets (formats + size caps)
  for SDK refs and catalog cards.
- `plugin-bubble-arbiter.ts` — priority/coalescing of transient vs pinned bubble
  slots.
- `plugin-diagnostics.ts` — per-plugin error/quota/settings-block collector for
  the inspector and health UI.
- `plugin-platform-settings.ts` — global gates for audio, voice, speech,
  microphone, quiet hours, and AI provider choices.
- `plugin-user-sound-store.ts` — stores imported user sounds as opaque refs, not
  raw filesystem paths.
- `plugin-i18n.ts` — resolves plugin locales, manifest `$t:`, and `ctx.t()`.

## Install paths

### Catalog install

`plugin-catalog.ts` fetches the active plugin catalog (v2; see
[catalog.md](catalog.md)) with timeout, redirect rejection, size cap, and cache.
`plugin-catalog-validation.ts` validates the catalog strictly. `plugin-package.ts`
downloads the ZIP from `zip.openpets.dev/plugins/`, **verifies SHA-256**,
restricts ZIP size/entries, extracts the **root manifest only**, checks
manifest↔catalog consistency, and installs to `userData/plugins/{id}`. It also
owns safe uninstall path resolution.

### Local development

`plugin-local-loader.ts` validates a selected local folder and **snapshots only
`openpets.plugin.json`** into `userData/plugins-dev/{id}`, with symlink/path/size
protections. Point the desktop dev build at a plugin root with
`OPENPETS_DEV_PLUGIN_ROOTS` (e.g. `plugins/official`) and run
`pnpm dev:desktop:plugins` for hot-load. See [development.md](development.md).

## Authoring workflow (end to end)

1. **Scaffold**: `openpets plugin new <name> --template <blank|reminder|ambient|ai-chat|tamagotchi|calendar>`
   generates a `manifestVersion: 3` package with `index.js`, `test.js`, README,
   and `locales/en.json`. (`packages/cli/src/plugin-templates.ts`.)
2. **Develop**: write against the SDK ([sdk.md](sdk.md)); hot-load via dev mode.
3. **Test**: `test.js` uses `@open-pets/plugin-sdk/testing` to fake time/events
   and assert descriptor-level effects — no Electron. See [sdk.md](sdk.md).
4. **Validate**: `openpets plugin validate <dir>` checks manifest, permissions,
   SDK compatibility, config field types, network hosts, asset formats/size
   caps, entry files, and HTML panels. (`packages/cli/src/plugin-validate.ts`.)
5. **Package & publish**: see below.

## Packaging, catalog & release validation

The release path is documented operationally in `web/docs/plugin-publishing.md`
and gated by the validators in [testing-and-validation.md](testing-and-validation.md).
The command surface (run from repo root):

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `pnpm plugins:check` | Validate the package plan (dry-run, no writes) |
| `pnpm plugins:package` | Write local catalog files + ZIP staging (no R2 upload) |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-release` | **Release gate** — catch production-breaking mistakes before shipping |
| `pnpm plugins:publish` | Generate + upload ZIPs to R2 |
| `pnpm plugins:validate-live` | Post-deploy validation against the live catalog |
| `pnpm plugins:deploy` | Deploy the web catalog |
| `pnpm plugins:test` | Run plugin locale checks + the official-plugin harness tests |

The release validator exists to catch exactly the production-breakers
`plugins:check` alone misses: unresolved `$t:` names/descriptions in catalog
cards, missing ZIPs, SHA mismatches, missing `locales/en.json`, missing declared
assets/entry files, and catalog/package drift. **Always run it before shipping a
plugin release.**

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---------|--------------|
| Plugin marked "broken" | Manifest/action validation failed — check `plugin-diagnostics` / the inspector |
| SDK call silently does nothing | Permission not declared or not approved; or blocked by a global platform setting (audio/voice/quiet hours) |
| Network call rejected | Host not in declared `network` hosts |
| Catalog card shows raw `$t:...` | Missing locale key — `validate-release` should have caught it |
| ZIP install fails | SHA mismatch, non-HTTPS/disallowed host, or oversized/invalid ZIP entries |
| Local plugin won't load | Local loader rejected the folder (symlink/path/size) or manifest isn't at root |
| Icon/image missing | Asset not declared in `assets`, wrong format, or over size cap |

## Where to look first

| Concern | File |
|---------|------|
| Manifest schema/validation | `plugin-manifest.ts`, `plugin-manifest-reader.ts` |
| Orchestration / UI actions | `plugin-service.ts` |
| Runtime / scheduling / broken-state | `plugin-runtime.ts` |
| Sandbox host | `plugin-js-host.ts` |
| Permission + dispatch | `plugin-sdk-bridge.ts` + `plugin-sdk-*.ts` |
| Catalog install/verify | `plugin-catalog.ts`, `plugin-package.ts` |
| Local dev load | `plugin-local-loader.ts` |
| Official plugin examples | `plugins/official/*` |
